# Armenian-Online-Job-Postings
Originally based on the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Data Wrangling course. Project from Kaggle.


## Dataset
The dataset used is hosted on Kaggle Datasets page: Armenian Online Job Postings. The online job market is a good indicator of overall demand for labor in an economy. This dataset consists of 19,000 job postings from 2004 to 2015 posted on CareerCenter, an Armenian human resource portal.

## Data Wrangling

### Gather
Download the file from Kaggle website and import that data into my programming environment.

### Assess

Assess data for:
- Quality: issues with content,i.e. many NaN in this dataset.
- Tidiness: issues with structure that prevent easy analysis.
  *Tidy data requirements:*
      *Each variable forms a column.*
      *Each observation forms a row.*
      *Each type of observational unit forms a table.*

Types of assessment:
- Visual assessment
- Programmatic assessment (used Pandas)

### Clean

Types of cleaning: Programmatic

The programmatic data cleaning process:
- Define: convert the assessments into defined cleaning tasks.
- Code: convert those definitions to code and run that code.
- Test: test your dataset, visually or with code, to make sure cleaning operations worked.
